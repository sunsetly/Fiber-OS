# Fiber-OS
Fiber OS is an operating system running on Scratch. It is currently on its 6th major version and needs a major refresh. That's where is repository comes in. The Fiber Team will post ideas and previews on here, and you can get a sneak peak at the future of Fiber. This is a way to receive more frequent updates, since the last update was in October 2014.
